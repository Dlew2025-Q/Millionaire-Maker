# render.yaml
# This is the blueprint for deploying the Millionaire Maker application on Render.
# It defines three services: a PostgreSQL database, a Node.js backend, and a React frontend.

services:
  # 1. The PostgreSQL Database
  # This service creates a managed PostgreSQL database instance.
  - type: pserv
    name: millionaire-maker-db
    # Render will automatically use the latest stable version of PostgreSQL.
    # The connection details (like the DATABASE_URL) will be automatically
    # injected into the backend service.
    ipAllowList: [] # Allows all IPs to connect. For production, you might restrict this.

  # 2. The Node.js Backend Server
  # This service builds and runs the backend/server.js file.
  - type: web
    name: millionaire-maker-backend
    # Specifies that this service should be built from a Dockerfile.
    dockerfilePath: ./backend/Dockerfile
    # Sets up the environment variables needed by the server.
    envVars:
      # The DATABASE_URL is a secret value that Render creates for our database.
      # We reference it here so our server can connect.
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        fromService:
          type: pserv
          name: millionaire-maker-db
          property: connectionString

  # 3. The React Frontend (as a Web Service)
  # This service now builds and serves the React app from its own minimal server.
  - type: web # CHANGED: Now a standard 'web' service for maximum compatibility.
    name: millionaire-maker-frontend
    # Specifies the directory where the frontend code is located.
    rootDir: ./frontend
    # Specifies the Dockerfile to build and run the frontend.
    dockerfilePath: ./frontend/Dockerfile
    # Sets up the environment variables needed by the frontend during the build process.
    envVars:
      # This tells the React app the URL of our backend server so it knows where to send API requests.
      - key: REACT_APP_API_URL
        fromService:
          type: web
          name: millionaire-maker-backend
          property: url
